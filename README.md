# BEAN MATCHINE

This is a game making framework (built on monogame) i work on whenever I get the urge to make a small game. I think its pretty good for me to use as i know exactly how it works but the documentation is non existant due to the fact its a little hobby.

## Cool Features

### Animation Manager:

The animation manager is one of the things i spent the most time on in this project. I have designed it to work very well with [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) so that i can animate a sprite and export it as a sprite sheet with some json to tell the engine what to do with it.

### Raycasts:

I wanted to add conext steering to my game so i added a raycast system to look out for colliders. i also added a way to draw the raycasts for debugging.

### Tiled Map Support:

I wanted an easy way to draw my maps so i added support for [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to quickly make maps.

## Future:

I will probably keep working on this whenever i feel like it but i dont have any massive plans right now
